## :books: Description

Volunteriis is a project about voluntering travelling the world. Its main objective is to help people who want to participate in tech conferences or music festivals and yet they do not have enough money to cost them. Thus, the project connects those people with organizators who need people for their events. Instead of having to pay a ticket for those events, which many times become rather expensive, they work for some time to get it. Moreover, the website also tries to facilitate the process of travelling to the event.

Volunteriis is done with React and Laravel. In the case of the APIs we tried to use the ones that helped to improve the user experience. On the one hand, we use Mapbox to help the users to better visualize the events that are already being prepared. On the other hand, we have used the API Tequila to help them to book the cheapest flight to go to that event.
